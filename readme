state of success 15 minutes before the end (désolé de pas être plus à jour)

rekt1: many teams
rekt2: concordia only
rekt3: none

very rekt 1: many teams
very rekt 2: udem and one other (don't remember)
very rekt 3: none


Here are the .java files (the less adapted language for this type of puzzles, lol) and the theoretical explanations in pdf.


1. My english is crap, so theoretical explanations are in french only.
2. I'm more math than programming, so I code like !""%?*
3. Code comments are in english only
4. More than half of the .java files are unnecessary for achieving the puzzles and were just used for validations.

very rekt 1 was easier thant I thought and had a too high score compared to other puzzle heroes in general (sorry). 
I'm sure you all found another solution than mine for this one.
Feel free to send me feedback if you had another solution for any other one!
